# Maze Racing

### A True Test of Lightning-Fast Reflexes!

This is a side project to help get more experience with SFML, C++, and game design. I originally made this in GameMaker when I was 11 or 12, and I think it's a simple enough game to implement. I've been meaning to learn SFML for a while now, but my C++ skills have never been up to snuff for making a game. That being said, I've been learning a lot so far, and will hopefully improve enough to make this eventually look and feel somewhat presentable.

Use the arrow keys to move the ship, and beware of the walls. The controls might take some getting used to, but that's part of the fun I swear.
